# Analysis Checklist

1. Domain & Source Analysis

- Check if the domain is on either the whitelist or blacklist.
- WHOIS Data: Analyze the domain's registration data (age, owner, and country) to spot red flags like newly registered domains or hidden ownership.
- SSL Certification: Verify if the site has proper security measures (e.g., HTTPS). Legitimate sites usually have valid SSL certificates.
- VirusTotal: Check if the domain has been flagged as malicious by VirusTotal API
- PhishTank: Check if the domain has been flagged as phishing by PhishTank API
